# Using NotebookLM with this Kit
We use NotebookLM as a **reasoning amplifier** and **forensics tool**.

### Setup Guide
1. **Create one Notebook** per Lab.
2. **Upload Sources:** Lab Markdown, YAML spec, and Run logs/memory dumps.
3. **Do NOT** upload all labs into one notebook.

### Prompting Pattern
1. **Grounding:** "Based only on the uploaded sources..."
2. **Specific Lens:** "...analyze from a reliability / governance / scalability perspective..."
3. **Action Output:** "...and propose concrete YAML or process changes."
