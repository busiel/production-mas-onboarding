# Start Here: Choose Your First Swarm

**Read This First:** You do not need to understand the entire stack to begin using it effectively. Choose based on what you want to accomplish first.

### The One-Page Decision Guide

#### 1. "I want to ship something structured and correct"
* **Architecture:** Hive-Mind (Hierarchical Queen-Worker)
* **Start with:** `labs/01-hive-mind.md`
* **Why:** Clear control, predictable execution. Best for API specs and pipelines.

#### 2. "I want to explore, research, or learn how agents think"
* **Architecture:** Mesh Research Swarm
* **Start with:** `labs/02-mesh-swarm.md`
* **Why:** No leader, disagreement is allowed. Best for research briefs.

#### 3. "I'm building a real product or platform"
* **Architecture:** DDD Microservice Swarm
* **Start with:** `labs/03-ddd-swarm.md`
* **Why:** Clear boundaries, failure isolation. Best for SaaS backends.

#### 4. "I want the system to improve over time"
* **Architecture:** Neural Adaptive Swarm
* **Start with:** `labs/04-neural-swarm.md`
* **Warning:** Start this only after you've run at least one earlier lab.

#### 5. "I need defensible, auditable decisions"
* **Architecture:** SPARC Decision Swarm
* **Start with:** `labs/05-sparc-swarm.md`
* **Why:** Traceability, dissent handling, governance-friendly.

**If You're Still Unsure:**
1. Start with **Lab 1 (Hive-Mind)**.
2. Then run **Lab 2 (Mesh)**.
