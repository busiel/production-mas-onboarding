# Production-Grade Multi-Agent Systems
## Antigravity + Claude Flow v3 Onboarding

### What This Is
This is a hands-on onboarding system for builders who want to start using the Antigravity + Claude Flow v3 stack effectively and safely. You will learn by running real multi-agent systems, inspecting how they behave, and iterating with confidence.

**This is not a tutorial series. It's a builder enablement system.**

### Who This Is For
* **Builders/Engineers** onboarding onto this stack.
* **Architects** designing agentic systems.
* **Researchers** exploring coordination, emergence, or decision systems.
* **Team Leads** enabling others without becoming the bottleneck.

### How to Start (5 Minutes)
1.  **Open NotebookLM**.
2.  **Create a new notebook** named `01-Hive-Mind`.
3.  **Read** [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md).
4.  **Open** `labs/01-hive-mind.md` and follow the instructions.
5.  **Observe** what the system does.

### Learning Path
| Lab | Architecture | Cognitive Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lab 0** | Environment | The stack works; memory persists. |
| **Lab 1** | Hive-Mind | Centralized coordination & execution. |
| **Lab 2** | Mesh Swarm | Emergence, disagreement & synthesis. |
| **Lab 3** | DDD Swarm | Production boundaries & blast radius. |
| **Lab 4** | Neural Swarm | Learning, adaptation & drift. |
| **Lab 5** | SPARC | Decisions, governance & traceability. |
