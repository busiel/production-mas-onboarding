# The Day 1 -> Day 7 Builder Ramp

**Purpose:** Help builders move from "new to the stack" → "productive and confident".
**Rule:** This is not a schedule you must obey. "Day" = unit of progress.

### Day 0: Orientation (15 mins)
* Read `README.md` and `START-HERE.md`.
* Open NotebookLM and create an empty notebook.

### Day 1: Proof of Life (Hive-Mind)
* **Lab:** `labs/01-hive-mind.md`
* **Focus:** Just observe behavior. Don't optimize.
* **Success:** You see tasks broken into phases and memory persisted.

### Day 2: Intelligence Has Shapes (Mesh)
* **Lab:** `labs/02-mesh-swarm.md`
* **Focus:** Watch disagreement emerge.
* **Success:** At least one contradiction is surfaced.

### Day 3: Production Reality (DDD)
* **Lab:** `labs/03-ddd-swarm.md`
* **Focus:** Boundaries and blast radius.
* **Success:** One domain can fail without killing the whole system.

### Day 4: Systems That Improve (Neural)
* **Lab:** `labs/04-neural-swarm.md`
* **Focus:** Explanations, not just raw performance.
* **Success:** The system can explain *why* it chose a specific agent routing.

### Day 5: Decisions That Last (SPARC)
* **Lab:** `labs/05-sparc-swarm.md`
* **Focus:** Tradeoffs and traceability.
* **Success:** An ADR (Architectural Decision Record) exists on disk.

### Day 6-7: Capstone (Make It Yours)
* **Action:** Modify a swarm to fit a real project OR break one intentionally and fix it.
* **Success:** You trust yourself to modify YAML and explain your design choices.
