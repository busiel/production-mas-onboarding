# Versioning & Learning Scope
**Current Version: v1.0.0**

### Backward Compatibility Promise
We do not invalidate prior learning. Older versions remain meaningful, even if newer ones exist.

### Semantic Versioning for Learning
* **MAJOR:** Fundamental mental model shifts (e.g., a coordination model is deprecated).
* **MINOR:** New labs or swarm patterns added.
* **PATCH:** Clarifications to instructions or examples.
